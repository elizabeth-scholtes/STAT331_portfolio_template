I. I believe that I have earned an A in the class.

II\. I have demonstrated an understanding all of the learning targets.

I have demonstrated the following learning targets:

WD-1 in Lab 4, Question 2. WD-2 and WD-3 in Lab 4, Question 4. WD-4: in Lab 3 Questions 2 and 4. WD-5 in Challenge 4 Question 3. WD-6 in Lab 4 Question 6. WD-7 in Lab 4 Question 7.

I demonstrated R-1 and R-2 in Lab 3 (but also seen in the rest of my assignments). R-3 in Lab 7 Question 6.

I demonstrated DVS-1 in a variety of ways in Lab 5 in every question. DVS-2 in Challenge 4 Question 4. DVS-3 in all of Challenge 2. DVS-4 and DVS-5 in Lab 4 in Questions 4, 5, and 6. DVS-6 in Lab 9 Question 13. DVS-7 in Challenge 9 Question 2.

I demonstrated PE-1 in Lab 3. In my original submission, I used the filter function multiple times in a pipe, but now I know to only call the filter function once. PE-2 in Lab 7 Question 4 & 6. PE-3 in Lab 4 Question 5 and Lab 8 Question 8. PE-4 in Lab 4 Question 7.

I demonstrated DSM-1 in Practice Activity 9.2. DSM-2 in Lab 9 Question 5 & 6.

III\. In addition to the learning targets, I have demonstrated my commitment to continued learning in a few different ways. The first is by completing the challenges, and the second is by completing revisions on my labs and challenges.

I believe I have gone above and beyond in my extended learning. This is shown in Challenge 2 and Challenge 8 where I attempted all of the modifications to in the assignment. I did a good amount of external research to figure out how to complete the challenges while also putting in a lot of effort in solving the problems.

I also believe that I have taken your feedback very seriously and have thoughtfully revised my assignments to help me better learn the material. This can be seen in my continued learning artifacts. One of the biggest improvements that shows my commitment to learning was the filter function. I have attached my reflection for Lab 3 which includes a deeper analysis of my learning. I have learned how to call the filter function only once rather than multiple times in the same pipe.

Outside of class work, I have grown as a team member and leader by working better in a group setting with in-class assignments. I feel like my group works well outside of the classroom with communication and asking/answering questions. These past few weeks we have worked even better in class, and I think we are all much more comfortable with each other, so it is easier for us to ask questions and also try to help each other. It feels like we are solving problems together rather than individually.

I have also contributed to creating a respectful classroom learning community. I have been respectful in class by arriving on time, listening to lectures, and helping out classmates whenever they need it. I also am respectful in that I have used the discord to ask questions and have asked my group questions. Additionally, I have done my best to submit a peer review as soon as possible so that my classmates can receive feedback in the most timely manner. I understand that everyone must be respectful and patient in order for all of us to grow and learn.

This quarter I feel like I have learned a lot in class as well as about myself. I have truly enjoyed the format of ungrading as well as meeting with you one on one for individual meetings. Something that will always stick with me is learning about the difference between asking for a grade saying I deserve it and earning a grade because I've worked for it.

Because I have demonstrated an understanding in all of the learning targets, been a good class mate and peer, and have been committed to continued learning, I believe I have earned an A in this class.
