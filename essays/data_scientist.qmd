I have improved as a practitioner and student of data science through the work this whole quarter. One of the biggest things that I learned was how to write tidy and efficient code. This improvement can be seen throughout the quarter in my improvement of using the filter function only once rather than calling it multiple times to do multiple filters. This can be seen in **Lab 3** when I only use the filter function once in each pipe. In my first attempt of the lab, I called the filter function at least 3 times in the same pipe.

A second concept that I am proud of is learning how to use pivots, or more broadly, working with data. This is very important in learning how to work with data, because most of the time, raw data does not come in a format that can be used right away. Being able to pivot data is crucial in data analysis. I showed my proficiency in pivots starting in **Lab 4 Question \_\_**, but continued to show my proficiency the rest of the quarter and even used it in the last lab, **Lab 9 Question** \_\_.

A final concept that I am proud of is creating readable and useful data visualizations with ggplot. I showed this in **Lab 7** where I created a simple plot in question 3 that had descriptive labels, a facet wrap, and multiple defined aesthetics.
